# raylib_ecs_sample
A simple Entity Component System using generic transforms for raylib.

An ECS is an entity component system. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system
It works by using composition rather than inheritance. This is a very quck and dirty ECS implementation using raylib.

This example show a few basic components that can be added to an entity including.

Transform
Camera
Drawable
Automover

These can be commbined to make a basic scene system with a transform heiarchy (parents and children).
